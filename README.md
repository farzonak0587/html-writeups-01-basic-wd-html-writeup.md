## Name: Farzona K
## Course: SEP10 Web Design
## Period: 8
## Concept: HTML

### Section: Context 
SEP began with a course on HTML, which is similar to the basics of web design. We study the basics, such as how to include headers, paragraphs, links, and photos. Although I had studied HTML in computer science last year, I still had trouble with it since I had forgotten.

#### Basics I learned: 
* `<h1>` is used for headings (there are 6 sizes, 1 is the biggest and 6 is the smallest.)
* `<p> Hello </p>` is used to make paragraphs
* `<ol>` is orderered list ( like 1. 2. 3.) and `<ul>` is used for unordered lists ( bullet points)
* `<img src="image.png">` is used to put images
* `<a href="another.website"></a>` is used to put links into the design

#### Process: 
 How I learned this was from [Free Code Camp](https://freecodecamp.org/) We were assigned to do the Legacy Responsive Web Design Challenges (Basic HTML and HTML 5). It was split into 2 parts because it had a total of 28 lessons. First we did 16 lessons on it, whcih was basically like `headers`, `paragraphs`, `ordered lists`, `unordered lists`, `images`, `links`  etc. Then reviewed it in class. For practice, we had to make our own little design. I made mine about a page where it teaches you how to make crepes. I had gotten a lot of practice there. When I was doing that assignment, I learned how to change the width and the height of an image. Then we had a quiz that had 10 questions on it, and it was about the first half of the FCC (Free Code Camp) lessons, for which I got a 9/10 on it. 
 
Then we were assigned to finish the rest of the FCC lessons. On those lessons, I learned how to make checkboxes, radio buttons, submit buttons, div elements, etc. For practice, me and my whole class had to figure out what 3 mistakes a web design had. We also had a whole lesson on `divs` and `spans`. We had to fix a web page and put `divs` and `spans` to make it look better and more organized. It was pretty easy to me because the FCC lessons had helped a lot. We didn't have any quizzes on it, but at the end of the unit we had to recreate a web design our teachers gave us. It had 3 levels: tough, tougher, and toughest. 

### Challenge 1

One of the biggest challenges I had was internal links. I had gotten really confused with the internal and external links and how the `attributes` and `id` were different. I didn't really understand from FCC because the lessons became kind of confusing for me, and I was just so lost. During classes I was lost too because I used to ask my friends for help and still wouldn't get it. I had studied it for the quiz we were going to have, but I still got a question wrong on it. 

The question was: If you have ```html <a href="#contacts">Contacts</a> ```, then you can make it an internal link as long as you have...?

The choices were: 

```html
* <h2 name="#contacts">Contacts</h2>
* <h2 id="#contacts">Contacts</h2>
* <h2 name="contacts">Contacts</h2>
* <h2 id="contacts">Contacts</h2>
```
I picked the ```html<h2 id="#contacts">Contacts</h2>``` because I knew it was one of the `id` ones. I had never heard of the `name` attribute, so I had the choice between 2 choices now. I went with the second one because it was the closest one to the question. My mind went black when I saw that question, and I didn't know what to do. 

Another challenge I had was with interanl links in the assignment where we had to recreate it. I didn't know how to make the link scroll down to the part it needed to scroll down. I was also working alone with that one because my partner was absent. I asked my friends, and they didn't know either. I spent a really long time trying to figure out what to do there until I looked it up because I had no other choice. That's when I realized I had to change the `id` and the`href` to`scroll.` I  had to put the `id`  inside the header. 

```html
<a href="#scroll">Basic Web Design</a>,
<a href="#scroll">Github</a>,
<a href="#scroll">Advanced Web Design</a>, and make a
<a href="#scroll">Freedom Project</a>

        <p> Lorem ipsum...</P> 
        </div>
<div>
 <h3 id="scroll">Basic Web Design</h3>
```
How it turned out: [ Recreating Tougher Web Design](https://app.pickcode.io/project/cm2dm4vgo1gu1koywia4y19en)

It took me a while to learn, but I've learned it now! I know how to create internal links and how to manage them now. 

### Challenge 2
This is probably my worst habit of all time, but I ALWAYS forget the most important things to do. For this class, I need to take notes because it will really benefit me and help me in the future. When I was doing my FCC lessons, the thought of taking notes didn't even come to mind until my teacher reminded me. Since I didn't take notes at all, I kept forgetting stuff and not being able to do this. If I had notes, it would have been so much faster and easier because I would have already known what to do. I created an extra step for myself. Whenver I didn't remember stuff, I went back to the FCC lessons and checked on what to do again. I always say I will do it later, but I end up forgetting. At the last minute possible, I decided to update all my notes because I was struggling so much that I couldn't take it anymore. Now I have good notes, and I dont have to go back to the FCC lessons to check on what to do. I really need to start remembering to take notes while I'm learning.

### Takeaways
The things I really need to remember are: 
* Links get really confusing sometimes, so you have to pay really close attention to them.
* Take NOTES whenever you can and when you are learning something new because it will help you so much.
* ASK TEACHERS FOR HELP !! ( cant learn all this by youurself and the most helpful person to you will be the teachers)
